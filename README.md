# Machine-Learning-Model-To-Diagnose-Depression
A classification machine learning model to diagnose depression using EEG data.

The machine learning model I built for my capstone project which is a mobile application to diagnose depression with the aids of EEG.

The dataset I am using is EEG data of 3-channel resting-state recordings from http://modma.lzu.edu.cn/.

The algorithms using in this model are: Data Preprocessing - Notch Filter,

Data Extraction - EEG Feature Extraction Toolbox from Mr.Too Jing Wei (https://github.com/JingweiToo/EEG-Feature-Extraction-Toolbox),

Data Selection - Binary Differential Evolution (The code is from Mr. Too Jing Wei, https://github.com/JingweiToo/Binary-Differential-Evolution-for-Feature-Selection),

Classification - Support Vector Machine,

Validation - 10-Fold Cross Validation
